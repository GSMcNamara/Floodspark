<h1>Floodspark Counterespionage Firewall (CEF)</h1>

Floodspark™ helps you record, block, or sandbox reconnaissance or otherwise illegitimate traffic. As a full-stack sensor Floodspark can help protect your websites, web applications, and APIs using more than just web traffic analysis. Using [Indicators of Intent™ (IOIs)](http://indicatorsofintent.com), Floodspark can detect and protect earlier than an Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) or IP blacklist-based solution.

Increase performance, reduce fraud, thwart attacks, and serve your real customers.  

To get started follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/GSMcNamara/floodspark/wiki/Installation)  

Feedback about features and functionality would be awesome. Development contributions would be even more awesome.  

Floodspark development is sponsored by GS McNamara LLC.
